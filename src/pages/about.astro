    <h2> About {identity.firstName}: One Minute Version </h2>
    <p> Honesty, Diligent, Analytical & Open-minded professional. Data-driven marketer. </p>
    <h2> About {identity.firstName}: Long Version </h2>
    <p> 
        I am a diligent and open-minded professional known for my integrity and adaptability. 
        With experience spanning both the financial services sector at Madison Trust and e-commerce operations at Scharf Industries, I've honed a versatile skill set.

        At Madison Trust, I collaborated across various departments, including compliance, investments, and marketing, leveraging data-driven insights to drive decisions. 
        My tenure at Scharf Industries, where I spent over five years, equipped me with expertise in the end-to-end process of selling on major platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart.

        My work philosophy is shaped by principles such as 'The 7 Habits,' 'Radical Candor,' and emotional intelligence. 
        I'm passionate about continuous learning and making a positive impact in the workplace, particularly in roles that allow me to harness the power of data to drive results.

    <h3> About this website </h3>
    <p> 
        This website is gradually being created using AstroJS.
        As a full-stack developer, I want to stay abreast on the latest technologies and create a blog website from scratch.
        Not sure where this coding adventure will take me. But stay tuned as it progressed further.
