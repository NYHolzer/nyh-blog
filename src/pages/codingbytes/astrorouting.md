# Effortless Navigation with Astro Routing: A Developer's Delight

## No Config, No Fuss: Just Add a File, and VoilÃ !

> *Tired of wrestling with complex routing configurations? Astro offers a refreshing approach that's as simple as placing a file! Let's dive into how Astro's intuitive routing system streamlines your development experience.*


### Static Routes
Do you enjoy organizing files on your computer? That's essentially how routing works in Astro. Every `.astro` file in your `src/pages` folder automatically becomes a route, mapping its location to its URL. Need an "About Me" page? Drop an `about.astro` file, and you're good to go.


### Dynamic Routes
But static isn't the only game in town. Astro unlocks the power of dynamic routes, letting you generate a whole constellation of pages from a single template. Just sprinkle some square brackets with a parameter name, and watch the magic unfold. `src/pages/products/[product-id].astro`, for example, creates a dedicated page for every product you add, all powered by the same template.
